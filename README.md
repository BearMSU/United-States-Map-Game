# 100-Days-of-Code-United-States-Map-Game
This is a united states map state guessing game. This is similar to the game you find to educate children on www.sporcle.com. This is the full code including CSV and Image files. It's complete in terms of the course, but I would like to add a timer down the road as well as maybe some other functionality such as winning the game.


Please enjoy and recommend any editing or updating you can think of.
