# 100-Days-of-Code-United-States-Map-Game
This is a united states map state guessing game. This is similar to the game you find to educate children on www.sporcle.com. This is the full code including CSV and Image files. It's complete, but I would like to add a timer down the road as well as maybe some other functionality such as winning the game. I'm hoping to make it a bit more fun for daughter next year when she needs to start learning this. It will be a great game for her to learn the states and locations on. My son will enjoy it too, but he's still got a few years before he's old enough to even understand this ðŸ˜€.


Please enjoy and recommend any editing or updating you can think of.
